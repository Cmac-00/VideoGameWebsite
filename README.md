# VideoGameWebsite

This project was part of my web development module at University. I initially had to create the look and feel of a website using client side code - (html, JS & css). 
I used JSON data to temporarily showcase some features on the website and create tables. 
I then found a csv file that had records of best selling video games and inserted the csv data into a database. The next stage of the project was to allow the user to 
Create, Read, Update & Delete data from the database using the website. I used PHP to create a REST API to read data and directly queried the database using SQL to add, update and delete 
data. 

This is the link to the website: http://cmcdowell29.lampt.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/videogamesales/home.html 

To enable the data editing you have to sign in:

Once signed in you can read some games I selected through an API - they are the sonic games. 
From here yo can update games, delete games and add new games.
